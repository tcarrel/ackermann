# ackermann
This is just two versions of one program to run the two-argument Ackermann function.
ack  : Runs the ackermann function on a loop incrementing the arguments each time.
acka : Runs the ackermann function once by taking two integers as command-line arguments.

# To Do
Use dynamic allocation to store values for previously calculated inputs to the recursive function to reduce the number of repeated computations.
